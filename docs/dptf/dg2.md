# algorithm Power share 
## Algorithm_without_slow_poll_optimization_v7.txt

DPTF implements a PID controller to track overall power head room available to the entire MCP.  

### Components of the PID 
1. PID_Budget[t] – This is a unitless quantity that tracks available power headroom.  This is the EWMA accumulator  
2. PID coefficients  
	o Kp – This is the proportional gain of the PID controller
3. PID Target – This is the target in Watts that the PID controller is expected to maintain the MCP to.  
4. Tau 
	– This is the time constant of the PID algorithm  
	– it defines the averaging interval for the PID controller.  
	- This is typically matched to the thermal capacitance of the form factor.  
	- Customers may request configurability of this parameter.  
	- If we are targeting the control loop to run every 100ms, Tau should be no smaller than 5x this number.  I would say we should target 1s Tau at the minimum.  
	- Alpha – is a derived factor that defines how much history we carry forward from one evaluation interval to another.  
	- Alpha = 1 – (sample_interval_period)/Tau.  
	- So for Tau = 1 Second, and a sample interval of 100ms,  
	- Alpha = 1 – (0.1/1) = 0.9  

### Loop   
Every 100ms (or every periodic interval)  
· Calculate utilization of the CPU die  
	- Option 1  
		1.  Read current value of PCU_CR_PKG_IA_C0_ANY_0_0_0_MCHBAR_PCU_ADDRESS  
		2. Calculate delta from previous sampled value   
		3. This register counts the number of clocks any IA core is active at a 100MHz heart beat.  
		4. Calculate time elapsed since last interval   
			• Delta_Time = current_time – prev_time  
		5. Delta_IA_C0_residency_pct = (current_IA_C0_ANY – last_IA_C0_ANY)*10ns / delta_time  
		6. Store the current C0 residency counter away for future computation. Last_IA_C0_ANY = current_IA_C0_Any  
	- Option 2  
		1. Use existing residency counter primitives that was used for HDC ('GPCU') or create a new one similar to that but which gets just the PKG utilization counters  
· Calculate utilization of the DGFX die  
	7. Plan is to use  (action: DGFX, method: 'GGAC')  
	8. The goal is to come up with effective C0 residency (or utilization of the GPU die) over the last evaluation interval  
· Calculate KBL H energy consumed over the last evaluation interval  
	9. Read PKG_ENERGY_STATUS MSR (MSR 0x611)  
	10. Calculate energy consumed over the evaluation interval  
	11. delta_energy_IA = (current_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS – las_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS)  
	12. This is a 64 bit counter that tracks energy consumed in fractions of Joules.  The fraction (or unit of measurement) is enumerated in PKG_POWER_SKU_UNIT.ENERGY_UNIT field. (MSR 0x606, bits[12:8])  
	13. A value of 3 for eg => unit is in 2(-3) joules = 1/8th of a joule.  
· Calculate energy consumed  by DGFX die over the evaluation interval  
	14. Plan is to use  (action: DGFX, method: 'GGAC' and 'GEU0' if needed)  
	15. Result is getting a delta_GPU_nergy  
· Calculate total power consumed by the MCP  
	16. Total_mcp_energy = delta_IA_energy + delta_GPU_energy  
	17. Delta_Time = current_time – prev_time  
	18. Total_mcp_power = total_mcp_energy/(delta_Time)  
· Calculate the available headroom  
	19. PID_budget[t] = PID_budget[t-1]*alpha + (1-alpha)*(PID_Target – total_mcp_power)  
	20. Where t-1 stands for the accumulated budget at the previous evaluation interval.  
· Translate accumulated budget to available TDP head room  
	21.  
		a.  
		iTerm[t] = iTerm[t-1] + PID_Budget[t] * timeinSecs * Ki  
		m_availableHeadroom = PID_Target + PID_budget[t] * Kp + iTerm[t]  
			• Where PID_Target is the power limit DPTF is configured to control the MCP to.  
			• Kp is the gain of the PID controller.  
			• Ki is the integral const.  
			• If PID_budget[t] starts becoming negative, current_TDP will be lower than PID_Target and we’ll start throttling both the dies.  
		b.  
		//We need to keep the iTerm windup separate from the Max_PL1_MCP check.  this allows the proper sharing of power and allow the package power  
		//to "Turbo" and exceed the PL1 limit for short duration.  
		if (m_availableHeadroom > (Max_PL1_CPU + Max_PL1_GPU)) {  
			iTerm[t] -= m_availableHeadroom - (Max_PL1_CPU + max_PL1_GPU)  
		}    
		else if (m_availableHeadroom < PL1Min for MCP) {    
		iTerm[t] += PL1Min - m_availableHeadroom    
		}    
		//Below we add a a separate check to limt the overall_current_TDP to keep at or below the Max and Min budget allowed.  This must  
		//be kept separate from the iterm windup check since.  This value is visible to UI and we should not show allowance of a total  
		//package power higher than the programmed Max_PL1_MCP  
		if (Overall_Current_TDP > PL1Max for MCP) {		  
			Overall_Current_TDP = MCP PL1Max  
		   }  
  		   else if (Overall_Current_TDP < PL1Min for MCP) {  
			Overall_Current_TDP = PL1Min   
		   }  
· Calculate BIAS for each of the dies and calculate effective budgets based on the BIAS  
	22. This step is needed to figure out how to split the overall TDP between the two MCP components (DGFX , and KBL H die)  
		 Implementation #1 – assuming run time tracking of utilization to infer BIAS works  
			i. Instantaneous_IA_BIAS = Default_Palo_BIAS * Delta_IA_C0_residency_pct  
			ii. Instantaneous_GPU_BIAS = Default_GPU_BIAS * Delta_GPU_C0_residency_pct  
			iii. Effective_IA_BIAS = 0.5 + (Instantaneous_IA_BIAS – Instantaneous_GPU_BIAS)/2  
			iv. Effective_GPU_BIAS = 0.5 + (Instantaneous_GPU_BIAS – Instantaneous_IA_BIAS)/2  
			v. if (graphicsUtil <= 5%)	{  
				Effective_IA_BIAS = 0.95;  
				Effective_GPU_BIAS = 0.05;  
		           }  
	23. effectiveProcessorTdpBudget = Overall_Current_TDP * m_effectiveProcessorBias;  
	    effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget = Overall_Current_TDP * m_effectiveGraphicsBias;  
· Rebalance unused budget  
	24.  
	if (rebalance_unused_budget) {  
	 	if (effectiveProcessorTdpBudget > processorPl1Max) {  
			remainingProcessorTdpBudget = effectiveProcessorTdpBudget - processorPl1Max;  
			effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget = effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget + remainingProcessorTdpBudget;  
		 }  
		 else if (effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget > graphicsPl1Max) {  
			remainingGraphicsTdpBudget = effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget - graphicsPl1Max;  
			effectiveProcessorTdpBudget = effectiveProcessorTdpBudget + remainingGraphicsTdpBudget;  
		}  
	}  
· Split the available TDP budget between the two dies  
	25. Palo_TDP_Budget = min(max(effectiveProcessorTdpBudget, Min_palo_power), Max_palo_power)  
	26. Alto_TDP_Budget = min(max(effectiveGraphicsTdpBudget, Min_alto_power), Max_alto_power)  
· Program the individual power budgets as the control points for each of the dies   
	27. For CPU – program this in PACKGAGE_RAPL_LIMIT MSR 0x610  
	28. For DGFX – action: DGFX, method: 'SPL0'.

## mail from Enriquez Montanez, Daniel

HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Video\<GUID>\0000\

The GUID will vary, however, only our driver will have a lot of reg keys starting with “@” in that path, so that way you know is the good one. The regkey should be a DWORD called:

DptfForceEnable
DptfUseSpoofValues

In the same path. This what it does is, to return hardcoded values for registers not yet ready, like setting PL4, Energy Threshold and some more. However for PL1 and PL2 and I think even for Tau should work. The names are case sensitive.

After setting the reg keys, please restart and it should be connecting via Kpe as usual.



testcase related to the PS2 story: 
AC 1,3 - 2266 - for activity status.  DPTF-PSPVTC-3357
AC 4-7 - 2313 utilization and energy. DPTF-PSPVTC-3360
AC 9 - 2269  - DPTF-PSPVTC-3361


no spoofing until we get new hardware.

MCPP dynamically created but require restart appstop/start doesnt work. 
MCPP added but still not showing in the table PSH2. 
Processor PL1 tau = 32 s

appstop / start needed for any change on MCPP to be impacted like PL1 .

PID target is always negative. 
CPU utilization is higher than expected. 



Slow poll.
